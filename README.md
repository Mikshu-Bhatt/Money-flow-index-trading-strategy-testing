# Money-flow-index-trading-strategy-testing

In this strategy we are using money flow index to determine the underbought and overbought conditions and trade accordingly.

First we are loading data of company to notebook. 

Then we are finding typical price, raw money flow, positive and negative money flow money ratio and with the help of all these money flow index.

we are creating a function to determine when to buy and sell. we are using buy and sell list to append the Adj Close price at which we are buying and selling.

we are giving a definite amount to use for trading.

After that we are  ploting Adj Close price with the buy list and sell list to visualize the time and amount at which we are buying and selling. We are also plotting the money flow index graph side by side.

Finally we are calculating the profit that you can gain via following this strategy.

# In this strategy we are making assumption that you need to buy and sell same amount of shares all the time. you can not short sell.
